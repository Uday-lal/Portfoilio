<h1 align="center">My Developer Portfolio ✨</h1>
<br />
<p>This is my online developer portfolio which contains both frontend and bactend. Yes it is very different and powerful compair to other portfolios it has a admin section from where i can control the entire website.</p>

## Features includes
✔ Authentication and authorization<br />
✔ CRUD Operations<br />
✔ Cloud Storage<br />
✔ NoSQL Database<br />
✔ Api calls<br />

### Let me tell you how it works!
<hr />
The entire backend of the site has two components. <br />
<b>🔥Firebase</b> and <b>🐱‍🏍Heroku</b> <br />
<b>🔥Firebase</b> handles the database and storage where as <b>🐱‍🏍Heroku</b> handles the api calls. <br />

#### So where do I use all this? 🤔
Well in the admin section of the site I can do things like
<ul>
  <li>Creating new admins</li>
  <li>Add new projects <i>By accessing the github api</i></li>
  <li>Add new skills</li>
  <li>And more</li>
</ul>
<br />
that's where I use firebase firestore database and firebase storage to store svg's of languages that I know and project related files (<i>Projects that cannot host as a website for example a game</i>)
